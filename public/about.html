<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Mutavhatsindi Phindulo, born on October 27th, 2000 at Tshilidzi Hospital. I am the third child of my mother, who has two other children: my older sister, Mutavhatsindi Gudani, and my brother, Khazwinake Mutavhatsindi. I love watching soccer, collecting soccer shirts, and playing chess. I'm known for being kind-hearted and helpful, but sometimes struggle with expressing my feelings

  I'm passionate about technology and find computer science fascinating. I recently graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Venda, and I hope to use my skills and knowledge to build a successful career. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, and I'm always up for an adventure. I also love learning new things, whether it's through books, movies, or podcasts. Life is full of possibilities, and I'm excited to see what the future holds

  All in all, I'm proud of who I am and where I've come from. I know that the journey ahead won't always be easy, but I'm ready to face the challenges with determination and resilience. Life is full of ups and downs, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to experience it all. And, I know that no matter what happens, I'll always have the support of my loved ones and my own inner strength to guide me
